---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**  
  The core programming language for building and orchestrating all components of your ML workflow—data processing, training scripts, API endpoints, and glue code for tools like DVC and MLflow.

- **DVC (Data Version Control)**  
  A Git-like system for versioning datasets, models, and pipeline stages. It helps you reproduce experiments and collaborate without storing large files in the Git repo, and enables pipeline orchestration.

- **Git**  
  Version control for code and lightweight files. Works in tandem with DVC to manage the code+data+model ecosystem in sync, allowing branching, reverting, and change tracking.

- **DagsHub**  
  A GitHub-integrated platform that brings Git, DVC, and experiment tracking together. Provides a UI to visualize experiments, compare runs, and store datasets and models—think of it as a collaborative MLOps dashboard.

- **MLflow**  
  An experiment tracking tool to log metrics, parameters, artifacts, and models. Lets you compare runs, register models, and optionally serve them via its model registry.

- **FastAPI**  
  A lightweight, high-performance Python web framework. Use it to serve trained models through RESTful API endpoints for real-time or batch predictions.
